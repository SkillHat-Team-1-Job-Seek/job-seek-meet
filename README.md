# About

**Problem:**  
As a job seeker, the job search process can feel lonely and isolating.

**Solution:**  
Our web app can help job seekers connect with other job seekers so they can co-work on the job search process to feel less lonely, share ideas, and have accountability.

This can function similar to Meetup.com. The idea is to create community for job seekers.
